<h1>Using Python</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
This project involved maintaining an allow list of IP addresses to ensure secure access to sensitive healthcare records. A Python script was created to remove specific IP addresses based on a provided remove list. The script opened the allow list file, read its contents into a string, converted it into a list, iterated through the remove list to identify IP addresses to be removed, and updated the file with the revised list of allowed IP addresses. This structured approach ensured that the allow list remained current and secure, preventing unauthorized access.
